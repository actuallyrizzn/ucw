# Universal Command Wrapper (UCW) - Production Requirements
# 
# UCW is designed to have zero external dependencies beyond Python stdlib.
# This file is included for future extensibility and optional features.
#
# Core UCW functionality requires only Python 3.7+ standard library:
# - subprocess (for command execution)
# - argparse (for CLI interface)
# - json (for output formatting)
# - os, sys, platform (for system operations)
# - pathlib (for file operations)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - abc (for abstract base classes)
# - re (for text parsing)
# - time (for execution timing)
#
# No external dependencies are required for basic UCW functionality.

# Future optional dependencies (commented out until needed)
# requests>=2.28.0  # For HTTP-based help fetching
# click>=8.0.0      # For enhanced CLI interface
# rich>=12.0.0      # For enhanced terminal output
# typer>=0.9.0      # For modern CLI interface
